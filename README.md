# NineLives

Purrsistent Cuteness and Cuddliness

## Overview

This tool is a proof-of-concept tool designed for entertainment purrposes. It
provides functionality for embedding whimsical metadata into cat images, and
viewing such images from publicly available sources online. It is intended to
explore novel ways of interacting with cat meme content, and nothing more.

The developers are not responsible for any misuse of this software. Any
resemblance to tools used in information security research, red teaming, or
covert communications is purely coincidental and highly discouraged.

If you are here looking for anything other than cute cats and cozy code, you're
in the wrong litter box. üêæ

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will build the project and create 2 binaries:

- `nle` - Your friendly neighborhood cat meme generator
- `nlc` - The helpful cat meme viewing tool
